My process
- Did nothing much here though.
- It actually didn't require much work. Just had to set up a structure and apply the neccessary Cascading styling. 
- Built the larger screens compatibility first, and then the mobile.

Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



Continued development

- I really love working with CSS flex model, I want to get as comfortable as possible with Grid display too. So, I'll be working with more of Grid now, going forward.
